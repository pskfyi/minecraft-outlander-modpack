# TODO

## Temporarily Removed

- [Compost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compost) is broken w/
  REI: [Compost/#7](https://github.com/yurisuika/Compost/issues/7)

## Known Issues

- When hunger drops to 3 shanks, the player moves exceptionally slowly.
  - This is an intended feature of the current build of Parcool when using
    hunger as the stamina system. Undocumented but noted in the Curseforge
    comments section. There's an open request to make it configurable.
- Loot tables contain OP items, especially in villages. This warps the early
  game too much.

## Action Items

- Use
  [KubeJS default options handling](https://kubejs.com/wiki/tutorials/default-options)
  for keybinds.

## Mods Under Consideration

- Visuals & Branding
  - Possible alternative to Packmenu:
    https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/its-the-little-things
  - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-skyboxes
