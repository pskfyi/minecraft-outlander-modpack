# TODO

## Compatibility Issues

Salt and associated systems added by The Salt and Vintage Delight need to be
reconciled.

## To Be Configured

- Parcool
- Cold Sweat

## Mods Not Yet Ready

[Grappling Hook Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod)
is stuck on an old version of Forge and I'm not willing to downgrade for it. I'd
also prefer a much simpler implementation.

[Create Style Modded Compats](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/create-style-modded-compats)
is stuck on 1.19.3.

[Simply Ceramics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-ceramics)
needs to be slightly more proven before I dive in.

## Open Issues

- HUD Compass does not support:
  - Map Atlases: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/14
  - Curios: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/21
    - I created
      [functioning data and resource packs](https://github.com/pskfyi/minecraft-compass-curio)
      to test this.
