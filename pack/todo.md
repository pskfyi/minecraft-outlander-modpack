# TODO

## Compatibility Issues

Salt and associated systems added by The Salt and Vintage Delight need to be
reconciled.

## To Be Configured

- Parcool
- Cold Sweat
- Thin Air
- Natural Progression recipes
  - Axes, saws, and shears should be able to strip bark in-inventory
  - All logs should use natprog-style plank recipes
    - Account for the Sawmill in the progression path
- More uses for tree bark
- Remove paraglider buildings from villages

## Mods Not Yet Ready

[Grappling Hook Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod)
is stuck on an old version of Forge and I'm not willing to downgrade for it. I'd
also prefer a much simpler implementation.

[Create Style Modded Compats](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/create-style-modded-compats)
is stuck on 1.19.3.

[Simply Ceramics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-ceramics)
needs to be slightly more proven before I dive in.

[Item Obliterator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/item-obliterator)
currently does not perform and of the desired functions in the Forge release.
(Can't ban items throughout REI.)

## Open Issues

- HUD Compass does not support:
  - Map Atlases: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/14
  - Curios: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/21
    - I created
      [functioning data and resource packs](https://github.com/pskfyi/minecraft-compass-curio)
      to test this.

## Mods Under Consideration

- Modpack Tools (Mostly new recipe/crafting mechanisms)
  - [V-Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/v-tweaks) has Anvil
    recipes and the ability to toss items into fuids to convert them
  - [Custom Fluid Mixin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-fluid-mixin)
    allows for fluid interactions like cobble generators
  - [Tool Progression](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tool-progression)
  - [Skill Slots](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skill-slots), the
    Jade and Lychee author's newest mod, allows for items to grant skills via
    KubeJS.
- Visuals & Branding
  - Possible alternative to Packmenu:
    https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/its-the-little-things
  - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-skyboxes
  - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drippy-loading-screen
