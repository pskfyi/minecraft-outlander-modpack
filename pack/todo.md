# TODO

## Temporarily Removed

- Cold Sweat, pending release of bugfix which impacts Supplementaries Sack items
  w/ Quark's renderer.
  - https://github.com/Momo-Softworks/Cold-Sweat/issues/267 (marked resolved,
    but issue persists)
- [Compost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compost) is broken w/
  REI: [Compost/#7](https://github.com/yurisuika/Compost/issues/7)

## Action Items

- Use
  [KubeJS default options handling](https://kubejs.com/wiki/tutorials/default-options)
  for keybinds.

### Compatibility Issues

- Salt and associated systems added by The Salt and Vintage Delight need to be
  reconciled.
- Thin Air's respirator is too easy to craft. I want to redo its recipe with a
  metal nugget as a "nose piece" and some textile rather than paper. To make
  this work thematically, I want to tweak the graphic.

## Mods Not Yet Ready

[Grappling Hook Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod)
is stuck on an old version of Forge and I'm not willing to downgrade for it. I'd
also prefer a much simpler implementation.

[Create Style Modded Compats](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/create-style-modded-compats)
is stuck on 1.19.3.

[Simply Ceramics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-ceramics)
needs to be slightly more proven before I dive in.

[Item Obliterator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/item-obliterator)
currently does not perform and of the desired functions in the Forge release.
(Can't ban items throughout REI.)

Both
[Roughly Enough Loot Tables](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-loot-tables)
and
[Roughly Enough Trades](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-trades)
are stuck on 1.19.x.

## Open Issues

- HUD Compass does not support:
  - Map Atlases: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/14
  - Curios: https://github.com/gigaherz/HudCompass/issues/21
    - I created
      [functioning data and resource packs](https://github.com/pskfyi/minecraft-compass-curio)
      to test this.

## Mods Under Consideration

- Modpack Tools (Mostly new recipe/crafting mechanisms)
  - [Custom Fluid Mixin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-fluid-mixin)
    allows for fluid interactions like cobble generators
  - [Tool Progression](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tool-progression)
- Visuals & Branding
  - Possible alternative to Packmenu:
    https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/its-the-little-things
  - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-skyboxes
  - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drippy-loading-screen
