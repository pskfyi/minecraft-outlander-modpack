# Outlander Modpack

## Design Pillars

1. **French Vanilla** – The themes and aesthetic of the pack should remain
   familiar and well-integrated with the base game.

   - Tech level should not exceed the
     [First Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution)
     except through fantastical means such as redstone and ender pearls.

   - No overhauls to the core look and feel of the vanilla game. No texture
     packs, bundled shaders, audio overhauls, etc.

   - Strong preference for environmental interaction in lieu of GUIs.

2. **Altered Progression** – Like a Skyblock pack, the pack should alter recipes
   and add mechanics which alter the standard flow of advancement.

   - This is a quest-driven pack with stages.

   - Stages should be gated by resources with unusual means of acquisition.

   - The start of the game is slower and harder to encourage caution and
     engagement, and to nudge players into settling down.

   - Ultimine and automation options significantly reduce tedium of midgame.

3. **Integration** – As much as it makes sense, mods should be integrated with
   one another. This will involve both mods which have built-in integrations and
   modded recipes to create integrations.
