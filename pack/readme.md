# Outlander Modpack

## Design Pillars

1. **French Vanilla** â€“ The themes and aesthetic of the pack should remain
   familiar and well-integrated with the base game.

   - Tech level should not exceed the
     [First Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution)
     except through fantastical means such as redstone and ender pearls.

   - No overhauls to the core look and feel of the vanilla game. No texture
     packs, bundled shaders, audio overhauls, etc.

   - Strong preference for environmental interaction in lieu of GUIs.
