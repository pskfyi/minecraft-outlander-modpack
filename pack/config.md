# Notes on Mod Configurations

## Cold Sweat

Added a Curios charm slot to hold the thermometer.

## Create and Quark

These are configured to remove their custom menu icons because I find them
cluttersome and distracting.

## Embeddium

- Disabled FPS display.

- Enabled Darkness Mode, set to Dark.

## Forge

Disabled the version check, which otherwise adds distraction to the landing page
and encourages players to update deps which is dangerous.

## FTB Ultimine

Configured to require tools, for better support of the Altered Progression
design pillar.

## Jade

Configured to hide mod names. This reduces visual clutter and promotes the
feeling of Integration that the pack is going for. It also removes an
omnipresent feeling of moddedness by not constantly reminding the player about
specific mods. Lastly it adds a small amount of mystery.

This is a rare setting and is likely to be polarizing.

## Map Altases

Configured to hide coords and biome names which IMO violate the vanilla
aesthetic, and to prevent the map from rotating with the player which I found
distracting and divergent from vanilla map behavior.

## Natural Progression

- Removed the ability to place pebbles because it has a bad interaction when you
  have a pebble in hand and right-click on a pebble on the ground, destroying
  the one on the ground. Removed placing sticks for parity.

- Disabled the nagging popup that you don't have the right tool. It's on me to
  make sure pack players understand this, not a constant popup.

- Disabled the damage effect when trying to mine an unmineable block because it
  triggers at inappropriate times when playing with a trackpad.

## Paragliders

Disabled everything except the glider itself (no worldgen, no stamina, no heart
containers) and turned down the speed by 40% to balance against the loss of the
stamina system.

## Parcool

TBD

## Quark

Disabled emotes. They add many entries to the Controls screeen and cause clutter
in the in-game talk GUI.

## REI

Using configuration to hide uncraftable items and items which the modpack
intends to treat as removed.

## Supplementaries

This version of the mod has a splash screen to warn about some items which were
separated into a companion mod. I've configured this screen not to appear.

## Waystones

Enabled feature to force Waystones to spawn in villages because I love them and
I feel they support the Adventure, Convenience, and Integration design pillars.
