# Notes on Mod Configurations

## Create and Quark

These are configured to remove their custom menu icons because I find them
cluttersome and distracting.

## Forge

Disabled the version check, which otherwise adds distraction to the landing page
and encourages players to update deps which is dangerous.

## FTB Ultimine

Configured to require tools, for better support of the Altered Progression
design pillar.

## Map Altases

Configured to hide coords and biome names which IMO violate the vanilla
aesthetic, and to prevent the map from rotating with the player which I found
distracting and divergent from vanilla map behavior.

## Paragliders

Disabled everything except the glider itself (no worldgen, no stamina, no heart
containers) and turned down the speed by 40% to balance against the loss of the
stamina system.

## Parcool

TBD

## REI

Using configuration to hide uncraftable items and items which the modpack
intends to treat as removed.

## Supplementaries

This version of the mod has a splash screen to warn about some items which were
separated into a companion mod. I've configured this screen not to appear.

## Waystones

Enabled feature to force Waystones to spawn in villages because I love them and
I feel they support the Adventure, Convenience, and Integration design pillars.
